Prototype = Interface
In computer programming, a function prototype or function interface is a declaration of a function that specifies
the function's name and type signature (arity, data types of parameters, and return type), but omits the function body. While a function definition specifies how the function does what it does (the "implementation"), a function prototype merely specifies its interface

Python assigns the name "__main__" to a script when executed, if the script is executed by
another script, it gets the given name i.e. test_script.py
So when executing a script __name__ == "__main__" will be true if executing within that script
