Wrap our heading and paragraph tags inside div tags.
That will keep them grouped inside the same section in the HTML document so that we can later apply CSS styling to that section

python script = coms b/w client/server
html = structure of pg content
css = presentation format, static files (no interaction) --> put in static/css folder
[brush up on css - .menu li + li ]

tweak the HTML files by adding more divs if you want more sections in your webpages.
