## Virtual Evn

- $ virtualenv flask # creates virtual environment with everything ya need [python interpreter & flask framework] :))

active virtual environment --> adds location of it's bin folder to system path so when you run stuff you get
the environment's version instead of the system's one.

can invoke interpreter by specifying path name i.e. path_to_mirocblog/flask/bin/python
