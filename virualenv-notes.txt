virtualenv is a Python library that creates a virtual environment with an isolated Python installation.
That installation will serve only to our flask web application, and not any other purposes. That will allow us to deploy a clean application to the online server.

good to have a clean environment that does not have to do with your main Python installation

The virtual environment files should be generated inside a folder that
is at the same directory level with the folder where your app files are.
It’s a good idea to create another folder (e.g. myblog) and put the app folder inside it.
Then, open a  terminal/command line while you in the myblog folder and type this:

tldr:
- new folder for app
- cd
- create virtual env
python –m virtualenv virtual

need to install flask in virtual environment
inside top level app folder

virtual\bin\pip install flask

this will install flask in virtual/lib/python3.5/site-packages
note:
virtual/bin/python
opens python install in the virtual env

run website in virtual env

you need to point to the isolated Python and then to the my-site.py script:
virtual/bin/python3 my-site.py
